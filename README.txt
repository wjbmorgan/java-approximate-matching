About this matching system:

1. The default location of data files in Windows is E:\\COMP90049 proj1\\film_titles.txt & E:\\COMP90049 proj1\\revs\\*.txt.

2. This system uses two ways to retrieve titles found in each review:
- By calculating the local distance between each title and each review, only those have a distance larger than a certain percentage of the length of itself would be considered as matches.
- By separating each review into subsets that have same number of words as each title (ngrams), if one of them has a levenshtein distance from this title that is shorter than certain number, this title is considered as a match.

3. There are three classes in this system: ApproxMatch.java, Readtxt.java, Test.java, which are included in this folder and an exported .jar file is also included.

4. With data files in default location this system can be compiled & executed. A sample output is attached. All the output can be seen in cmd since it would take too much time to output complete results in file.

5. Due to the varieties of title forms (some even simple like "G"), it is nearly impossible to find a single best match for each review, so all the possible matches are retrieved, separated by "... ".
